# Issue Summary — CDISCPILOT01 ADaM Derivation

Generated 2026-07-29. Data-quality gate: **PASS** (0 error-severity failures). Conformance: **11/11 datasets OK**.

## SDTM Data Issues

| # | Domain | Issue | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | AE | `AEBODSYS` is **blank on all 74 records**. | `AESOC` used for the SOC hierarchy instead. Confirmed programmatically in `03_safety.R`. Without this check the AE tables would have had an empty SOC column. |
| 2 | CM | **Not WHO-DD coded** — no `CMDECOD`, `CMCLAS` or `CMATC`. 52 distinct verbatim terms over 68 records. | T-14-7.04 can only summarize verbatim `CMTRT`; the conventional therapeutic-class hierarchy is not producible. |
| 3 | CM | 31 of 68 `CMSTDTC` values are **partial dates** (year or year-month only). | `ASTDT` set to NA for those records; `ASTDY` retained. Handled by `safe_date()`, which reports the count rather than erroring or silently coercing. |
| 4 | MH | Uncoded, single term "ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE" for all subjects. | T-14-1.04 degenerates to one row (critic finding R-5). |
| 5 | FA | Injection-site reactions collected on only **8 of 17** safety subjects. | The other 9 are censored in ADTTE, which understates the event rate. The KM figure requires a footnote. |
| 6 | LB | No clinical-significance flag; 6 qualitative tests (ANISO, COLOR, KETONES, MACROCY, POIKILO, UROBIL) have no numeric result. | Qualitative tests excluded from continuous summaries; `CSCFL` all-missing (SD-4). |
| 7 | DM | 1 of 18 subjects (CDISC015) is a **screen failure** with a blank ARM. | Excluded from ITT/SAF/EFF by construction. |

## Derivation Assumptions

| # | Assumption | Where |
|---|---|---|
| A1 | Analysis-visit targets: Baseline d1, Wk2 d15, Wk4 d29, Wk6 d43, Wk8 d57, Wk12 d85, Wk16 d113, Wk20 d141, Wk24 d169, Wk26 d183; nearest-target windowing on `xxDY`. | `00_setup.R::window_by_day` |
| A2 | Each instrument is windowed onto **the target set it actually uses**, not the full study schedule — windowing PHQ-9 onto Week 8 (which it never collects) would misassign its Week-12 records. | `02_efficacy_bds.R` |
| A3 | Baseline = last non-missing record with `ADY <= 1`. For AVLT-REY that is SCREENING 2 (day -2/-1), since the instrument has no BASELINE visit (SD-2). | `derive_baseline()` |
| A4 | `TRTEMFL` = AE start on/after first dose and on/before last dose + 30 days. | `03_safety.R` |
| A5 | `SWLSTOT` = sum of the 5 SWLS items, missing unless all 5 present. All 27 visit-level totals had `NITEMS = 5`. | SD-1 |
| A6 | Hy's Law `CRIT1` = ALT or AST >= 3xULN **and** BILI >= 2xULN, using record-level `LBSTNRHI` as ULN. **0 subjects met the criterion.** | SD-derived |
| A7 | ADTTE risk set = all `SAFFL='Y'` subjects; those with no injection-site reaction censored at last day on study drug. | See SDTM issue 5 |
| A8 | Exposure duration = last `EXENDTC` - first `EXSTDTC` + 1 (range 1-189 days). | `03_safety.R` |

## Data-Quality Gate

**PASS — 0 error-severity failures.** Full results in `data-quality.md`. Highlights:

- **MANDATORY RULE 1 verified**: all 3,322 LB and 1,414 VS source records survive windowing; the 4 unscheduled LB visits and all 6 PHQ-9 EARLY DISCONTINUATION RETRIEVAL records are retained. Those 6 ED records fall at study days 169-173 and window into Week 24 — a nominal-`VISITNUM` map would have deleted every one of them and left the primary endpoint with 2 subjects.
- **MANDATORY RULE 2 verified**: no subject with a baseline and a post-baseline value is missing from any endpoint analysis. LOCF supplied 2 of 10 PHQ-9, 1 of 9 SWLS and 6 of 11 AVLT-REY endpoint records.
- **MANDATORY RULE 3 verified**: pooling on randomized (`ITTFL='Y'`) counts collapses all 6 sites into group 900.
- **NG-4 assertion corrected during the run.** It was first written as an equality (`endpoint N == eligible N`) and failed on ADFTAVLT and ADRSHAMD. Both failures were the same subject, CDISC007, who has an *observed* Week-24 record but no baseline, so `CHG` is missing. The derivation was right; the assertion was wrong. The rule's actual semantics is a **shortfall** test — *no eligible subject may be missing* — and extra baseline-less endpoint records are legitimate. Re-expressed as a set-difference test, which passes.

## Conformance Failures

None outstanding. One was found and fixed during the run:

- `metatools::check_variables()` flagged **`ARMCD`, `ACTARMCD`, `TRTP`, `AGEU`, `AGEGR1N`** as present in the derived ADSL but absent from `adam-spec.json`. `TRTP` is the grouping variable every single analysis-spec entry references, so its omission from the spec was a real defect, not a cosmetic one. The spec was updated and the check now reports *no missing or extra variables*.

## Corrections Made to the ADaM Spec During Derivation

| ID | Correction |
|---|---|
| SD-7 | **`AVL02-List A Total` is scored per trial, not per visit.** AVLT-REY administers List A seven times (`FTREPNUM` 1-7): trials 1-5 are learning trials, 6 is post-interference recall, 7 is 30-minute delayed recall. The spec treated it as one score per visit; the generic nearest-day flag would have silently analysed one arbitrary trial. Corrected to `AVLATOT` = sum of trials 1-5 (Total Learning) and `AVLADEL` = trial 7. A related trap: `FTDTC` carries a per-trial timestamp and must not be part of the aggregation key. |
| SD-3 | **Corrected.** The spec asserted HAMD 17 has no post-baseline data. It has no *scheduled* post-baseline visit, but the ED RETRIEVAL records land in the Week-24 window and **0 subjects have both a baseline and a Week-24 value**, so a change-from-baseline analysis is derivable. `BASE`/`CHG` are now derived. This is the exact failure mode Rule 1 exists to prevent — reading the nominal visit list hid real data. |
| COMPLFL | Expected N corrected **6 -> 3**. The spec counted DS *records* (2 per subject); there are 3 completing subjects (CDISC005, CDISC009, CDISC011). |
| ADSL vars | 5 variables added (see Conformance above). |

## Unresolved Gaps

| # | Gap | Status |
|---|---|---|
| G1 | **SD-4** — the lab "clinically significant change" criterion is defined by neither the protocol nor any available SAP. `CSCFL` is derived all-missing per the 2026-07-29 review decision. | Open, by decision. T-14-6.03 must footnote that the criterion is unspecified. |
| G2 | `DV` domain absent — no protocol-deviation output possible. | Open; data-transfer question for the sponsor. |
| G3 | Concomitant medications uncoded — no therapeutic-class table. | Accepted limitation. |
| G4 | **Analysis-set sizes are far below any interpretable threshold**: ITT 306, Safety 254, Efficacy 0, Completers 110. The PHQ-9 primary endpoint has 10 analysis records of which only 8 are observed. | Accepted; every downstream inferential result must be labelled illustrative. |
| G5 | `SITEGR1` has a single level, so it is rank-deficient as an ANCOVA covariate. | Expected (SD-6). The generator must refit without it and footnote the fallback. |
| G6 | Hy's Law: 0 subjects meet the criterion. | Not a gap — a genuine (negative) finding. T-14-6.06 will be an all-zero table. |

## Available-But-Unused Analyses

- **HAMD 17 change from baseline at Week 24 (n=0)** is now derivable following the SD-3 correction. The reviewed plan places T-14-2.02 in section 14-2 as a baseline summary (critic finding R-3, resolved by human review). The CFB analysis is *not* substituted silently; raise it if you want T-14-2.02 restored to section 14-3 as a treatment-effect table.
- **`AVLADEL`** (AVLT-REY 30-minute delayed recall) is derived but no planned table consumes it.

## Package Installation

No packages required installation — all of admiral 1.4.1, dplyr, tidyr, lubridate, stringr, rlang,
haven, xportr, datasetjson, metacore 0.2.1, metatools 0.2.0 and jsonlite were already present under R 4.4.0.
